# Description

For this assignment I created my own portfolio site that includes a clear title and functional navbar, a recent photo, brief bio, portfolio of my work with links to deployed apps, and contact info. 

At the moment, the entire work section is filled with placeholders, as I do not have any completed apps at the moment. I will update this page as I progress through the course, adding new projects as they are completed. 

This page has been deployed on Github as a work-in-progress, and can be viewed here: https://tomekregulski.github.io/portfolio/

# What I Learned

This project has served to not only solidify what I have learned about HTML and CSS thus far, but also challenged me to expand my working knowledge of the languages in order to meet the functionality requirements.

I am excited to know that I am now capable of producing an elegant site suing a popular deisng layout, as well as knowing that I am able to seek out my own solutions to unique design and functionality needs.
